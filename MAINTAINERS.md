# Maintainers

## Current Maintainer Team

## Maintainer Responsibilities

- keep the project aligned with mission and principles
- protect quality gates (`lint`, `typecheck`, `test`, `build`, `audit`)
- review security-sensitive changes with extra care
- moderate community interactions and enforce code of conduct
- maintain roadmap clarity and release notes

## Adding Maintainers

New maintainers are added by consensus of existing maintainers based on:

- sustained high-quality contributions
- constructive collaboration style
- reliability across code, reviews, and community support

## Inactive Maintainers

If a maintainer is inactive for an extended period, active maintainers may update this file and `CODEOWNERS` to keep project stewardship responsive.
