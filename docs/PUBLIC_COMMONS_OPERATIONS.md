# Public Commons Operations

This runbook is for operating an official shared Debate Wise instance.

## Core Objectives

- Keep discourse quality high
- Keep moderation decisions transparent
- Keep contributor and user trust high

## Weekly Operations

1. Review open moderation and abuse reports.
2. Check platform health (CI, security alerts, runtime errors).
3. Publish one short update on shipped improvements.
4. Refresh `docs/GOOD_FIRST_ISSUES.md` for contributors.

## Moderation Baseline

- Enforce `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` consistently.
- Escalate severe cases through documented maintainer channels.
- Keep moderation actions auditable and explainable.

## Incident Response

1. Triage severity (security, abuse, reliability, data integrity).
2. Stabilize service first (rate limits, temporary feature flags, rollback).
3. Communicate status publicly with concrete next update time.
4. Publish a short post-incident summary with follow-up actions.

## Community Feedback Loop

- Route major product/policy changes through RFCs (`docs/RFC_PROCESS.md`).
- Convert recurring user pain points into roadmap items.
- Close the loop by referencing shipped fixes in release notes.

## Success Signals

- Median moderation-response time
- Repeat constructive participants
- Contributor merge throughput
- Reduced unresolved abuse reports
