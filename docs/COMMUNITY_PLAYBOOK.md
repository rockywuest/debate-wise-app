# Community Playbook

This playbook helps maintainers grow a healthy contributor community around Debate Wise.

## Core Community Goals

- onboard thoughtful contributors quickly
- keep contribution quality high without creating gatekeeping
- maintain a respectful, evidence-oriented collaboration culture

## Monthly Maintainer Cadence

1. Curate and refresh `docs/GOOD_FIRST_ISSUES.md`
2. Close stale triage items that are already resolved
3. Publish a short "what shipped / what is next" update
4. Identify one onboarding improvement from contributor feedback

## New Contributor Funnel

1. Contributor opens first issue/PR
2. Automated welcome comment points to setup/check docs
3. Maintainer responds with concrete next step
4. First merged PR is acknowledged publicly in release notes

## Review Guidelines

- prioritize correctness, security, and maintainability
- give actionable feedback with exact file paths and suggestions
- explain tradeoffs, not just preferences
- avoid blocking on cosmetic issues when behavior is correct

## Community Health Signals

- median time to first maintainer response
- median time to first merged PR
- returning contributor ratio
- share of issues solved by non-maintainers

## Escalation Rules

- conduct problems: follow `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`
- security concerns: follow `SECURITY.md`
- major design conflicts: use RFC process (`docs/RFC_PROCESS.md`)
