# ADR-0001: English-First Repository and Bilingual Product

- Status: Accepted
- Date: February 22, 2026

## Context

Debate Wise targets a global open-source contributor base. Collaboration quality and discoverability are highest when repository-level communication is in one common language.

At the same time, product users include both English- and German-speaking audiences.

## Decision

- Repository language is English for:
  - docs
  - issues
  - pull requests
  - governance and process files
- Product language support remains bilingual (EN/DE).
- English is the default fallback language in-app.

## Consequences

- Lower friction for global contributors and maintainers.
- Better consistency in reviews and governance discussions.
- Ongoing responsibility to keep EN/DE user-facing copy aligned.
