# Governance

This project exists to help people reason better together. We optimize for long-term societal value over short-term engagement metrics.

## Project Principles

- Truth-seeking over popularity
- Intellectual honesty over rhetorical wins
- Open collaboration over gatekeeping
- Safety and dignity over abuse tolerance

## Decision Model

We use a lightweight "maintainer-led, contributor-informed" model.

- Maintainers make final merge and release decisions.
- Significant changes should be discussed in issues or RFCs first.
- Contributors are expected to challenge ideas with evidence and clear reasoning.

## Roles

- Contributor:
  - opens issues and pull requests
  - proposes improvements and fixes
- Reviewer:
  - reviews code, docs, and product implications
  - helps maintain quality and consistency
- Maintainer:
  - responsible for merge decisions, release quality, and moderation
  - stewards roadmap and community standards

Current maintainers are listed in `MAINTAINERS.md`.

## RFCs for Major Changes

Use the RFC process for architecture, moderation model, security posture, reputation rules, or governance changes.

- Process: `docs/RFC_PROCESS.md`
- Template: `docs/RFC_TEMPLATE.md`

## Conflict Resolution

- Start with public technical discussion in issues/PRs.
- If unresolved, a maintainer makes a decision and documents rationale.
- Conduct issues follow `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`.
